# Monkytype Clone - Typing Speed Test

Welcome to the **Monkytype Clone**! This project replicates the core functionality of [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com), a popular website designed for testing typing speed. The project focuses exclusively on the **frontend** implementation, featuring clean, responsive design and dynamic sentence generation. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with sentences sourced from a JSON file to simulate realistic typing tests.
